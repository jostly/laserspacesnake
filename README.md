Laser Space Snake
=================

Shoot asteroids to split them apart, and pick up the smallest asteroids to increase score and extend snake.

Steer with left and right arrow, fire lasers with space bar.

If the snake head gets hit with a big asteroid, it's game over. If the body gets hit, the segments are
damaged, but they can be repaired by picking up small asteroids.
